# My Flutter Authentication App

This is a mobile app built with Flutter that provides functionality for users to log in, sign up, reset their password, and enter an OTP (one-time password) for two-factor authentication. The app uses a Python/Django backend to handle user authentication and data storage.

## Features

- Password reset and email verification via OTP
- Two-factor authentication with OTP
- User account management (viewing and updating user information)

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Set up the Python/Django backend according to the instructions in the `backend/README.md` file.
